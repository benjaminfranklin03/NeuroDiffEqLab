## Project Overview

**NeuroDiffEqLab** provides an in-depth, low-level exploration of Neural Differential Equations. Every model is implemented without high-level libraries, focusing on the mathematical foundation and methods from the original research. This approach offers full control over each componentâ€”from forward integration to backpropagation with adjoint methods.

The repository is organized around Jupyter notebooks and source files, complete with explanations and visualizations, making it ideal for both learners and researchers to explore the mechanisms and applications of Neural DEs.


Hereâ€™s what you can expect:
- **Hands-on implementations** of various Neural DE models.
- **In-depth documentation** explaining how each model works.
- **Cool visualizations** to showcase the power and behavior of these models.
- **Thoughts and reflections** as I navigate through the complexities of each approach.

## Implemented Models

### 1. Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs)

**Description**: Neural ODEs model the hidden state dynamics of a neural network as a continuous-time ODE. This allows for adaptive computation and better handling of complex temporal dependencies.

### 2. Augmented Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (ANODEs)

**Description**: ANODEs take Neural ODEs a step further by augmenting the hidden state with additional dimensions. This boosts the modelâ€™s expressiveness, allowing it to capture even more intricate dynamics.

### 3. Neural Stochastic Differential Equations (Neural SDEs)

**Description**: Neural SDEs introduce stochasticity into the ODE framework, making them perfect for modeling data with inherent randomness and uncertaintyâ€”think financial time-series or noisy sensor data.

### 4. Neural Controlled Differential Equations (Neural CDEs)

**Description**: Designed to handle irregularly sampled time-series data, Neural CDEs treat observations as control paths. This makes them incredibly robust for datasets with sparse and irregular intervals, like healthcare records or traffic data.

### 5. Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)

**Description**: PINNs integrate physical laws described by partial differential equations (PDEs) into the training of neural networks. This allows for solving complex physical systems by embedding domain knowledge directly into the model.
